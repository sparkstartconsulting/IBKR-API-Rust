# IBKR-API-Rust

## This branch is currently in progress to upgrade to version 10.12.01.  Do not use until it is merged to master!!!

Port of Interactive Broker's trading API written in Rust (API_Version=10.12.01)

Please see the latest IB Tws Api documentation here: <http://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/introduction.html>.

The documentation has information regarding configuring Trader WorkStation and IB Gateway to enable API access.

For usage of this library, please see the example implementation in [src/examples/test_helpers/manual_tests.rs](src/bin/manual_tests.rs)

The main structs and traits that clients will use are [**EClient**](src/core/client.rs) , a struct that is responsible for
connecting to TWS or IB Gateway and sending requests,  and [**Wrapper**](src/core/wrapper.rs), a trait that clients will implement that declares callback functions
that get called when the application receives messages from TWS/IB Gateway.

## Example

In the example below, TWS will send the next valid order ID when the sample application connects. This will cause the ***Wrapper*** callback method
***next_valid_id*** to be called, which will start sending test requests to TWS (see the
***start_requests*** method in ***TestWrapper*** which is called by ***next_valid_id***).

```rust, no_run
use twsapi::core::errors::IBKRApiLibError;
use twsapi::core::client::EClient;
use std::time::Duration;
use twsapi::examples::test_helpers::TestWrapper;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

fn main() -> Result<(), IBKRApiLibError> {
    let wrapper = Arc::new(Mutex::new(TestWrapper::new()));
    let app = Arc::new(Mutex::new(EClient::new(wrapper.clone())));

    println!("getting connection...");

    wrapper.lock().expect("Wrapper mutex was poisoned").client = Option::from(app.clone());

    app.lock()
        .expect("EClient mutex was poisoned")
        .connect("127.0.0.1", 4002, 0)?;

    thread::sleep(Duration::new(18600, 0));

    Ok(())
}
```

## TODO

- [X] Expand documentation - Done
- [ ] Write automated tests - in progress
- [ ] Write an async function in TestWrapper that checks when next_valid_id has been populated by the callback
- [ ] Publish to crates.io
